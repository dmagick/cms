<h3>Hi and welcome!</h3>

This website is here to show images of Sydney, Australia. I usually end up at one of the many beaches around Sydney's east coast, wondering what the new day will bring. It's always different and interesting to watch and try to capture what I see. I hope you enjoy looking at the photos and I'd love to hear from you. You can email me directly - chris@splashofphotography.com or use the <a href="~url::baseurl~/contact">contact form</a>.<br/><br/>

Cheers!<br/>
Chris.
