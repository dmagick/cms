Hi and welcome to my photo site!<br/>
My name's Chris and I love getting out as much as possible to take photos around Sydney and when possible, other parts of Australia. A lot of my pictures are taken on weekends when I can get up early (before my kids are awake!) and heading down to a beach close to where I live. Even though I go to the same areas all the time they are always different.<br/><br/>

If you have any questions or comments, you can either email me - chris@splashofphotography.com, or use the <a href="~url::baseurl~/contact">contact form</a>, I would love to hear from you!
